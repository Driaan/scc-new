1mNAME0m
       scc-win - file formats used by SCC


1mRELEASE0m
       scc-win	 1.10.38


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       SCC  stores  configuration data from systems in flat files called snap‐
       shots. All configuration data is structured  by	prefixing  it  with  a
       fixed-variable  indication and with a hierarchical classification.  The
       indication, all elements of the classification  and  the	 configuration
       data are separated by colons.

       By  comparing two consecutive snapshots and ignoring the variable data,
       we are able to maintain a logbook of a system.  Lines  in  the  logbook
       also consist of colon separated fields.


1mSNAPSHOTS0m
       Each installed hotfix is recorded in the snapshot in the following way:

	    fix:system:hotfix:KB834707::Description	 : Windows XP Hotfix - KB834707
	    fix:system:hotfix:KB834707::FixComments	 : Update
	    var:system:hotfix:KB834707::InstalledBy	 : Administrator
	    var:system:hotfix:KB834707::InstalledOn	 : 8/26/2005
	    fix:system:hotfix:KB834707::ServicePackInEffect   : SP3


       After the indicator "fix" for fixed data, there are at most five levels
       of hierarchical classifications of the remaining data. The  classifica‐
       tion and the data are separated by two consecutive colons.

       When  additional	 hotfixes  are	installed, new entries in the snapshot
       will be reported in the logbook.	 The reported data contains the change
       itself (the hotfix) and the classification of the new data (system:hot‐
       fix:KB999999::).


1mCLASSIFICATIONS0m
       The output of scc-collect is checked by scc-log. Any line that does not
       start with "fix:" of "var:" is prefixed with "fix:messages::", indicat‐
       ing unexpected output from one of the commands used by scc-collect.  As
       the html-file groups data per classification, the original snapshot has
       to be inspected to locate the commands causing this output.

       The snapshot is converted to a hierarchical menu. Therefore the follow‐
       ing combination of classifications cannot be used:

	  fix:software:myprogram::
	  fix:software:myprogram:config::


       The  first classification results in html-code to access "myprogram" as
       an option in the sub-menu "software".  The second classification should
       result  in  html-code  to  access a sub-menu "myprogram" containing the
       option "config".

       It is the responsibility of the developer to  ensure  a	correct	 menu-
       structure  by  using  the correct classifications in scc-collect and in
       the plug-ins.  This kind of errors is  detected	and  reported  in  the
       snapshot by scc-collect.


1mLOGBOOK0m
       Two consecutive snapshots are compared using diff. The resulting output
       is altered to indicate the old and the new configuration.  A  shift  in
       daylight saving time is recorded in the logbook:

	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:result::different
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:runtime::19
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:count::4
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:previous date::2006-03-25
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:previous time::17.33.26
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:data::old::general::CurrentTimeZone: 60
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:data::new::general::CurrentTimeZone: 120
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:data::old::general::DaylightInEffect:0
	    2006-03-28:20.46.29:data::new::general::DaylightInEffect:1


       Again we see colon separated fields. The first fields indicate the date
       and time of the change. Then there is a classification of the remaining
       fields, separated by two, consecutive colons from the differences.  The
       classification is limited to: result,  remark,  count,  previous	 date,
       previous time and data.

       After  reporting	 the result and some administrivia, finally the actual
       change is reported. The keyword old indicates that this data  was  only
       present	in  the	 old snapshot. So it has been removed from the current
       configuration of the system. The keyword new indicates that  this  data
       only appears in the current (new) snapshot.
