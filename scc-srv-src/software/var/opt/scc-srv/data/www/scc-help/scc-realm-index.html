		<P>
This page enables the system administrators to view and search the configuration data and logbooks of 
systems and to compare parts of the configuration of two systems.
		</P>

		<P>
The viewing and searching is performed by the upper part of the page.
First indicate one or all systems for the requested operation.
Then indicate the area of the operation: Configuration, Logbooks, Rules or System Management Tools.
To see the requested summary, use the START button.
When you want to search, enter a search string and indicate case-sensitivity before using the START button.
By default the number of displayed search results per system comprise 10 lines and 1000 for a single system.
Unchcek the "Limit search results per hosts" to display all search results for all systems. 
Note that this can flood your browser for large environments and a less deterministic search string.
		</P>

		<P>
This page is generated by
<A HREF="scc-srv/scc-summary.html">scc-summary</A>.
The presence of the Rules part is determined by the file
<SPAN CLASS="filename">&lt;realm&gt;/custom/scc-rules.conf</SPAN>.
This file is used by <A HREF="scc-srv/scc-rules.html">scc-rules</A>.
When it finds out that a rule is not obeyed, the label will be colored <SPAN CLASS="warning">red</SPAN>.
The presence of the System Management Tools part is determined by the file
<SPAN CLASS="filename">&lt;realm&gt;/custom/scc-smt-select</SPAN>.
This file is used by <A HREF="scc-srv/scc-smt.html">scc-smt</A>, which is called by scc-update.
It basically summarizes groups of systems running the same version of the software listed in the file scc-smt-select.
		</P>

		<P>
The lower part of the page is used for comparing (parts of) snapshots of two systems.
Select two systems to compare and indicate in the (multi-selectable) list of classifications which parts
of the snapshots should be compared.
Then use the START button to activate the comparison.
The selection of the data to be compared can be further controlled from the command-line of 
<A HREF="scc-srv/scc-syscmp.html">scc-syscmp</A>.
		</P>
		<P>
Use <A HREF="scc-srv/scc-realm.html">scc-realm</A> to maintain realms. 
It can be used to create realms and to add and delete systems from a realm.
		</P>
		<P>
A realm is a separate directory with symbolic links for snapshots, logbooks and the html-files 
pointing to the default directory where these files are collected for all systems.
Access to the separate directory should be restricted by a <SPAN CLASS="filename">.htaccess</SPAN> file.
The presence of symbolic links in this directory indicates the right to access the configuration 
data of the corresponding systems.
