		<P>
System management tools are determined by <A HREF="scc-srv/scc-smt.html">scc-smt</A>
by means of the contents of the selection file <SPAN CLASS="filename">custom/scc-smt-select</SPAN>.
All snapshots in a realm are searched for installed software (filesets, depots and packages) that are mentioned in the selection-file.
When the configuration file does not exist, no SMT-data is selected and the home page of the realm will not show an SMT-entry.
		</P>
		<P>
When you edit the custom configuration file and you install a new version
of scc-srv, scc-smt notifies on the generated page that the default 
configuration file is different and more recent then the specific 
configuration file in custom. In that case, check the default 
file for additions/changes from the new scc-srv version or touch
the specific file in custom to avoid this message.
