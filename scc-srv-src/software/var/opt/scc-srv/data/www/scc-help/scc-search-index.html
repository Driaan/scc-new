software should be marked as System Management Tool.

		<P>
This summary contains the result of searching in the messages of a realm.
The messages are determined by <A HREF="scc-srv/scc-rules.html">scc-rules</A>, 
that uses the optional file<SPAN CLASS="filename">custom/scc-rules.conf</SPAN>.
The order of the data is determined by the rules in the configuration file.
		</P>
		<P class="header">Amount of results</P>
		<P>
When searching all systems, the matched data is limited to 10 lines per system.
When only one system is searched, the matched data is limited to 1000 lines.
To get all resulting data, switch to the command-line and use grep on the corresponding files.
Except when none or all of the systems matched, a brief summary of the name, model and OS is shown shown for the non-matching systems.
