		<P>
This summary contains a list of all systems in a realm.
Additional data indicates the model, OS and the date of the last recorded change in the logbook.
All data is presented in a single table and also available for download in CSV format. 
The headers of the columns of this table point to pages where the data is sorted on the contents of that column.
		</P>
		<P>
The URL for the runtime cells points to a page with statistics of the runs of the system.
When gnuplot (tested with version 4.0) is installed, graphs for runtimes and number of changes for each run are displayed on the statistics page.
To offload the generation of the summary pages, the statistics pages are generated on request.
