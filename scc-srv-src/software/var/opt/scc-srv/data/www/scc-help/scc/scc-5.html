1mDESCRIPTION0m
       System  Configuration Collector is yet another configuration collector.
       Just like the other collectors it collects configuration data  on  Unix
       systems. The difference is that each line of collected data is extended
       with a hierarchical classification of the nature of the data  and  with
       an  indicator  whether  that  data is supposed to be static or dynamic.
       For example: the size of a file system is static data and  the  current
       usage  is  dynamic  data. Consecutive collections of configuration data
       (snapshots) are compared and differences in the static data  are	 added
       to  a  logbook.	Filling a file system will not be reported in the log‐
       book, but the extension of a file system will be.  Additional  software
       converts the snapshot and logbook to html-format.

       The  classification  of the data is a hierarchy with the following top-
       level items (among others):

       - general
       - boot
       - hardware
       - Volume Management
       - kernel
       - network
       - software
       - system
       - users


1mSummary of transfer of SCC-data0m
       Basically there are three setups: push, pull and two-step.

       In the push setup, all clients schedule <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> with the -p and  the  -s
       options and transferred data is processed on scc-srv by means of sched‐
       uled invocations of scc-update.	This setup requires (non-root)	access
       of all clients to scc-srv, except when data is transferred via email.

       In the pull setup, scc-srv schedules scc-pull with the -R option to run
       the client, obtain the data and process	the  transferred  data.	  This
       setup  requires	superuser  access  from	 scc-srv  to  all  clients and
       involves all systems in a realm and all scc client  scripts  should  be
       accessible via the same path.  Note that scc-win clients do not support
       pulling scc data.

       In the two-step setup, all clients schedule <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> with -p pull	option
       without the -s option and scc-srv schedules scc-pull with the -R and -n
       options to obtain and process the client	 data.	 This  setup  requires
       (non-root)  access from scc-srv to all clients and involves all systems
       in a realm and all scc client data should be accessible	via  the  same
       path.

       These three setups could be mixed on a realm basis.


1mINSTALLATION0m
       SCC  is	available  in many native system package formats and also as a
       source tarball.	The software from the depots/packages/rpms on the web‐
       site  is	 NOT relocatable, it installs in 4m/opt/scc/bin24m Data- and tempo‐
       rary files are located in 4m/var/opt/scc24m and config files in 4m/etc/opt/scc0m
       It  is  possible	 to install the software in other directories.	Unpack
       the source tarball, edit and use the relocate script and	 generate  the
       required	 rpm/package.	Throughout this documentation only the default
       directories are mentioned.

       During the pre-install phase, the software runs	a  possibly  installed
       version	of SCC to capture the changes in configuration just before the
       installation.  During the post-install phase, the software removes  the
       current	snapshot  (made by the previous version of SCC) and starts the
       new version of SCC.  This means that SCC does not compare two  possibly
       incompatible  snapshots,	 avoiding  flooding  the  logbook with changes
       caused by code changes.

       This means that the installation may take  some	time  (typically  less
       than  5 minutes).  On a moderate pentium with CentOS 6, SCC completed a
       run within 1.5 minutes.	On large  and  overloaded  servers,  SCC  will
       require much longer.

       To install release 1.25.35 of the source package, use the commands:
	    tar xf scc-1.25.35.src.tar
	    cd scc-1.25.35
	    ./scc-install


1mPROGRAMS0m
       The programs of SCC have the following relationship:

       scc: main program
       this program calls scc-log and sends data to the SCC-server.
       scc-log: this program calls:
       - scc-collect: collect all data by calling modules in scc_modules
       - scc-cmp: compare new and old snapshots, add differences to logbook
       - scc-snap2html: convert snapshot to HTML
       - scc-log2html: convert logbook to HTML


1mUSING SCC0m
       After   the   installation,   the   data	  is  available	 in  directory
       4m/var/opt/scc/data.24m	The file 4mscc.&lt;hostname&gt;.log24m  contains  the	 logbook
       and the file 4mscc.&lt;hostname&gt;.cur24m contains the current snapshot.

       To  run	SCC  again,  just start 4m/opt/scc/bin/scc.24m	To keep an accurate
       logbook of your system, you can schedule it with cron:

	    0 6 * * * /opt/scc/bin/scc

       Any errors produced by programs called by scc-collect, appear under the
       classification  "messages".  Most of the times they indicate some hard‐
       ware or software error on the system.  Running SCC is some  kind	 of  a
       health check for your system.

       It is possible to send your SCC-data (snapshots, logbooks and the html-
       files) to a  server  running  the  server-software  of  SCC  (scc-srv).
       Before  you  send your data to a server, you have to prepare the server
       by installing scc-srv and configuring the server.  On the server,  sum‐
       maries of the SCC-data are generated and all data is accessible through
       a web-interface.

       To mark the completion of certain changes you performed	on  a  system,
       use  the	 4m-c24m  option  of  1mscc(1).	 22mTo mark changes in the snapshot when
       implementing a RFC, use the following commands:

       scc		  # record changes up to this moment
       # perform the tasks required by the RFC
       scc -c "RFC 123"	  # record changes due to RFC


1mCUSTOMIZING/EXTENDING SCC0m
       1mscc-collect(1) 22mand its modules use sensible defaults to avoid that many
       systems	require	 a configuration file.	When the defaults are insuffi‐
       cient, check the code for a reference  of  scc-localize.	  This	script
       contains	 several  environment variables that influence the behavior of
       scc.   To  adjust  scc,	copy  4m/etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-localize24m	 to
       4m/etc/opt/scc/conf/scc-localize24m  and	 uncomment  the required variables.
       When the --no_conf_sub_dir option was used with	the  relocate  script,
       the copy is not required.

       1mscc-collect(1)	 22mcollects OS and OS-related configuration data.  It does
       not collect data of the applications  you  developed.   To  extend  the
       snapshots,  refer  to  the  manual  page of 1mscc-plugin(1).  22mIt offers a
       starting point to collect other configuration data.

       DBAs will only be interested in part of the SCC-data of a  system.   By
       using the file 4m/etc/opt/scc/conf/scc-split.conf24m it is possible to split
       the snapshot in several parts.  Each Oracle SID can have its own	 snap‐
       shot  and  logfile.   When  these snapshots are send to the scc-server,
       they can be added to a separate realm that only	contains  SCC-data  of
       Oracle  SIDs.   Refer  to  4m/etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-split.conf24m and to
       1mscc-log(1) 22mfor examples and more details.

       SCC ships with several user modules that are not run by default.	 Check
       the  directory 4m/opt/scc/bin/scc_modules24m for scripts containing "_u_" in
       their name.  These are user-modules that can be activated by  means  of
       the  4m-e24m  option of scc.  Refer to the manual page of <A HREF="scc-collect.html">scc-collect(1)</A> and
       <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> for a more detailed description of the use of modules.

       Module scc_0640_s_local uses a configuration file to collect  the  con‐
       tents  of additional files.  Use this module to extend the SCC snapshot
       on individual systems.  To extend the SCC snapshot on all systems,  you
       better customize the code and generate your own version of SCC.

       To  add or modify specific user modules for all your systems, customize
       the depot/rpm and packages.  This can  be  achieved  by	unpacking  the
       source  tarball	and adding/modifying the required files.  Refer to the
       README file in the source tree for more	details	 concerning  producing
       the depot/rpm/package.


1mPERFORMANCE0m
       Usually	scc  completes	its runs within minutes.  When you notice that
       runs of scc on a system take very long to complete,  you	 can  use  the
       profiling  data to determine the cause.	Profiling data is added to the
       snapshot and can be found in the html-file  under  the  classification:
       "profiling".  The html file of the snapshot contains a "Statistics" ta‐
       ble containing the processing times of (parts of)  the  modules.	  Look
       for  large  values in the "Module seconds" column to locate the code of
       scc that is causing this performance  problem.	Optionally  add	 extra
       calls to the scc_timing function to exactly determine the bottleneck.


1mSECURITY0m
       As the programs of SCC is by default run as root to obtain all the nec‐
       essary configuration data, the environment of SCC  must	be  well  pro‐
       tected.	 This is accomplished by creating separate directories for the
       data and programs of SCC and properly securing them.

       Optionally a source package can be build from the SVN sources that will
       run SCC as an ordinary user.  Note that this reduces the amount of col‐
       lected configuration data and could lead to "messages" in the  snapshot
       when  used  programs  produce  data on stderr as they are not called by
       root.
