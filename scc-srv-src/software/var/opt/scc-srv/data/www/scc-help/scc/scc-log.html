<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
<PRE>

	This program calls scc-collect to create a SCC-snapshot and compares
	it with a previous snapshot. All differences are added to a logbook.
	Finally, both the new snapshot and the logbook are also written in
	HTML-format. Refer to <A HREF="scc-4.html">scc(4)</A> for a detailed description of the format
	of the snapshots and logbooks.

	scc-collect runs system and user modules. Each module collects
	specific configuration data. You can extend the "reach" of scc by
	writing and scheduling your own user modules. Refer to <A HREF="scc-collect.html">scc-collect(1)</A>
	for a detailed description of modules and how to schedule and maintain
	them.

	The data in the snapshot can be split into several, partial snapshots. 
	This is done before comparing it with a previous snapshot. The mechanism
	can be used to provide Oracle DBA&#39;s with a snapshot for each Oracle 
	instance. It can also be used to separate each package in a ServiceGuard
	cluster. The partial snapshots of these packages can be compared on the
	scc-srv. This avoids many changes in the logbooks of a cluster, when a
	package "switches".
	Refer to the file /etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-split.conf for more details.

	The contents of the data generated by the modules are tested to 
	check their format. Lines with unknown formats are prefixed with the
	classification: "fix:messages::". The philosophy of scc is to collect
	data, not to interpret it. scc signals when it is unable to collect
	configuration data. Any interpretation of the correctness of the
	data can be done by the program scc-rules of scc-srv.

	In rare occasions, scc-collect "hangs". Use the following command
	to find the child processes of scc:
		UNIX95= ps -Hef
	This will show you the entire process-tree. On Solaris, you can use
	the ptree command from the proctools. Find the "deepest" descendant
	from scc-collect and kill this process. Then issue the command again
	to monitor the progress of scc-collect.

	On abnormal termination of scc-collect, the new snapshot probably is
	incomplete. When the cause of the problem is removed, a new run of
	scc can be started. This leads to large differences with the new,
	complete snapshot. To avoid this, use the -r option of scc-log to
	remove the current snapshot before making a new one.

	When the abnormal termination of scc-collect was not detected, the
	next run of scc will add many differences to the logbook. To reduce
	the size of the logbook, the log file can be edited by hand and the
	differences can be deleted.

</PRE>
<H2> LIMITATIONS</H2>
<PRE>

	As the rpm-database is locked during the install of scc, the snapshot 
	made during the install does not contain any rpm-data. To avoid massive
	changes in the logbook during the pre-install run and the run after the
	install, the rpm data is taken from a "keep" file. Each run of scc that
	is not performed during install, records all rpm data not only in the
	snapshot, but also in the keep file. This mechanism does not work for
	the initial install of scc as the keep file does not yet exist. In that case
	all rpm changes are ignored and this is recorded with a specific remark
	in the logbook.

	This mechanism is also used for packages on BSD systems.

	On AIX systems, the installed rpm packages are also listed as AIX
	installp packages. To avoid changes in the logbook for each install of
	scc, the above mechanism is extended to AIX packages when rpm packages
	have been installed.

<H2> ARGUMENTS</H2>
<PRE>

	None.

</PRE>
<H2> OPTIONS</H2>
<PRE>

	Note that the --pretrans, --preinstall, --postinstall and --preremove options 
	are used by package management scripts. Please use with care!

	-c|--comment &lt;remark&gt;   Add a remark to the logbook, indicating a "specific" 
	                        reason to run scc. For instance to mark the successful
	                        configuration/change of a system. An empty &lt;remark&gt; means
	                        no comment.
	-e|--extra &lt;mod&gt;        scc-collect runs all system modules and matching &lt;mod&gt; user modules.
	                        Where &lt;mod&gt; can contain shell filename wildcards. When used in 
	                        combination with the -v option, make sure that each 
	                        invocation activates the same set of user modules.
	-S|--selection &lt;mod&gt;    Run selected (system or user) module(s) for virtual host (-v).
	                        Where &lt;mod&gt; can contain shell filename wildcards.
	                        To detect and process layout version changes, use the -r option
	                        on the next invocation or include module general in the selection.
	-f|--fqdn               Use the full qualified name, not the short
	                        hostname, when sending files to the SCC server.
	                        On the SCC client, all filenames contain the 
	-h|--help               Display the syntax and exit.
	-l|--label &lt;label&gt;      Label to indicate the function of the system. Use &lt;label&gt;
	                        in the webinterface of scc-srv to select/group systems.
	                        An empty string means: no label.
	-m|--max_age &lt;max&gt;      Entries in the log-file, that are older than &lt;max&gt;
	                        months, are deleted
	--pretrans              Check whether an already installed instance of scc is active.
	--preinstall            Run before an install, sets SCC_INSTALL_PHASE.
	--postinstall           Run new version after install, implies -r option and sets
	                        upgrade comment and SCC_INSTALL_PHASE.
	--preremove             Remove data directory prior to removal of the software.
	-r|--reset              Remove the current snapshot to avoid comparing it with
	                        the new (incompatible/incomplete) snapshot.
	-v|--virtual &lt;host&gt;     Do not use the hostname of the system, as base for all
	                        scc-files, use &lt;host&gt; instead. This option should be
	                        used to run specific modules via -e and/or -S option.

</PRE>
<H2> DIAGNOSTICS</H2>
<PRE>

	This program writes the following messages to stderr:

	Syntax error, use: scc-log [ -c|--comment &lt;remark&gt; ]
	        [ -e|--extra &lt;mod&gt; ] [ -S|--selection &lt;mod&gt; ] [ -f|--fqdn ]
	        [ -h|--help ] [ -l|--label &lt;label&gt; ] [ -m|--max_age &lt;max&gt; ]
	        [ --pretrans | --preinstall | --postinstall | --preremove ]
	        [ -r|--reset ]
	        [ -v|--virtual &lt;host&gt; ]
	A syntax error has been detected and reported.

	scc-log: Syntax error, missing argument for option &lt;option&gt;
	The indicated option is missing argument(s).

	scc-log: another instance is active, check process ID in &lt;lock&gt;
	This program compares a new snapshot with a previous one. When more
	than one instance of this program is active, they use the same files
	to store their new version of the snapshot. Therefore only one 
	instance of scc-log should be active.
	In rare occasions, a system program, called by scc-collect, might hang.
	When that is the case, try to kill the child processes of scc-collect.
	The lock file contains the PID of scc-log. When the lock-file exists and
	the process with the PID does not exist, the lock file is removed and 
	scc-log continues to run. Remove the lock file only when you are
	certain that scc-collect is not running.

	scc-log: non-numeric argument for -m option: &lt;max&gt;
	Use only numeric arguments for -m option.

	scc-log: cannot use -S option without -v option
	Limiting system modules only makes sense for a virtual host run.

	scc-log: use -e and/or -S option with -v option
	The -v option can only be used when the -e and/or -S option is used.

	scc-log: insufficient permissions to write in data directory: &lt;data_dir&gt;
	To run this program, log in as the owner of the directory.

	scc-log: no class actions found for host: &lt;host&gt;
	The split file specifies host &lt;host&gt;, but did not find any data for it.

	scc-log: scc-collect failed.
	Check the temporary files of scc-collect to determine the cause of the failure or
	set environment variable SCC_DEBUG and call scc-collect with the -i option.

</PRE>
<H2> EXTERNAL INFLUENCES</H2>
<PRE>

	During the pre- and post-install, the existence of the lock-file
	scc.lock is checked to find out whether scc is running.

	When diff is absent, the logbook will be left empty and all compares
	should be done on the scc-srv.

	Use environment variable SCC_DATA to specify an alternative directory
	for the SCC data files. Should be an absolute path.

</PRE>
<H2> RETURN VALUE</H2>
<PRE>

	Upon completion, the program returns one of the following values:

		0 successful completion
		1 Syntax error
		2 Runtime error

		This file can be used to provide each Oracle instance with
		its own snapshot. The file is installed in the subdirectory
		newconfig to avoid that your changes are erased by an upgrade.
