       scc-win	 1.10.38


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       System  Configuration Collector for Windows is a clone of SCC for Unix.
       It uses WMI to access system to collect their configuration data.   The
       file  formats  are  identical  to SCC for Unix.	Each line of collected
       data is extended with a hierarchical classification of  the  nature  of
       the  data  and  with  an	 indicator whether that data is supposed to be
       static or dynamic.  For example: the size of a file  system  is	static
       data  and the current usage is dynamic data. Consecutive collections of
       configuration data (snapshots) are  compared  and  differences  in  the
       static  data  are added to a logbook. Filling a file system will not be
       reported in the logbook, but the extension of a file  system  will  be.
       Additional software converts the snapshot and logbook to html-format.

       The  classification  of the data is a hierarchy with the following top-
       level items (among others):

       - general
       - boot
       - hardware
       - kernel
       - network
       - software
       - system
       - users

       Development of SCC started for Unix and later Windows was added.


1mINSTALLATION0m
       From release 1.7 onwards, SCC for Windows is available as a 32-bit  MSI
       generated  by  means of Wix (http://wixtoolset.org/).  As this MSI does
       not recognize installs of versions 1.6 and earlier, you	will  have  to
       explicitly  uninstall the previous version (after running it to collect
       any changes up to the upgrade).	The new version uses the same  folders
       and  scripts  as the 1.6 release and thus the scheduling of SCC runs is
       identical.  From release 1.7 onwards, SCC is not run from the  install‐
       er.  Use your own scheduling before and after the install.

       SCC  uses  WMI  to  access  other  systems than it is installed on.  It
       requires perl on the system it is installed on.	 The  executable  perl
       should  be  in  the PATH when SCC is run.  The current release has been
       tested with the perl distribution from Active State:
       http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/
       The software installs by default in "c:\program	files  (x86)\scc\bin".
       SCC-data is located in the data folder.	Temporary files are located in
       tmp and documentation in the doc folder.	 The shortcuts in the  program
       group point to the proper files.

       Before  installing  an  upgrade of SCC, run SCC for all systems you are
       collecting data from.  Otherwise all changes between the last  run  and
       the  upgrade are lost.  The new version of SCC will detect the old lay‐
       out of the present snapshots and ignore all changes.  This is  done  to
       avoid  numerous changes in the logbook when the layout of the snapshots
       has changed.  Therefore you should not wait too long before running SCC
       after  upgrading	 to  avoid missing changes between the upgrade and the
       next (scheduled) run of SCC.

       When SCC is uninstalled, the directories 4mbin24m and 4mdoc24m are removed.   The
       4mdata24m  and 4mtmp24m directories remain intact to support upgrades.  They have
       to be removed manually when you no longer want to use SCC.


1mDEPENDENCIES0m
       The software uses several other open source programs.

       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bsdtar.htm
       From bsdtar for Windows the following files are included	 from  version
       2.4.12:
       - bsdtar.exe
       - libarchive2.dll
       - bzip2.dll (version 1.0.5)
       - zlib1.dll (version 1.2.3)

       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm
       From coreutils the following file is included from version 5.3.0:
       - sort.exe

       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm
       From  DiffUtils for Windows the following file is included from version
       2.8.7:
       - diff.exe

       The two above programs require the  following  libraries	 that  can  be
       downloaded from either of the two above pages:
       - libiconv2.dll
       - libintl3.dll

       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm
       From OpenSSL the following files are included from version 0.9.8h:
       - openssl.ex
       - libssl32.ddl

       http://www.blat.net
       To  send	 email	from  the command-line, the following file is included
       from version 3.2.3:
       - blat.exe

       http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
       To transfer files by means of scp, the following file is included  from
       version 0.71:
       - pscp.exe



1mCOMMUNICATION0m
       The  data  that	is  collected  can  be sent to the server part of SCC.
       Assume  that  the  data	should	be  sent  to  directory	 /var/opt/scc-
       srv/data/transfer/cp/,	  owned	   by	 user	 root,	  on	system
       scc_srv.domain.com.

       The first step is to get the host-key  of  scc_srv.domain.com  in  your
       local  cache.  To achive this, we start a dummy copy operation in a cmd
       box:


       The servers host key is not cached in the registry. You
       have no guarantee that the server is the computer you think it is.
       The servers dss key fingerprint is:
       ssh-dss 1024 a1:4e:1b:6a:18:1a:7f:34:fa:25:32:5a:5f:64:ea:d5
       If you trust this host, enter "y" to add the key to
       PuTTYs cache and carry on connecting.
       If you want to carry on connecting just once, without
       adding the key to the cache, enter "n".
       If you do not trust this host, press Return to abandon the
       connection.
       Store key in cache? (y/n) y Enter
       root@scc_srv.domain.coms password:

       Enter a bogus password to abort the transfer, as we do not really  want
       to copy scc.pl to the server.

       Now generate a local rsa-key using WinSCP.

       - locate and start PUTTYGEN.exe
       - click Generate
       - move the mouse around as instructed to create entropy
       - in the box labelled "Key comment", type in a short string to identify
       yourself e.g. scc_from_your_client.domain.com (no spaces!)
       - do not select a passphrase
       - click both  the  Save	buttons	 and  name  your  keys,	 traditionally
       id_rsa.pub  for public key and id_rsa for private key (it will be named
       id_rsa.PPK) in the scc\bin folder.
       - select the contents of the box at top of the PuTTYgen (labelled "Pub‐
       lic key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file").
       -   paste   the	 key  into  the	 file:	~root/.ssh/authorized_keys  on
       scc_srv.domain.com (make sure to have mode 700 for .ssh/	 and  600  for
       authorized_keys)

       Now issue the command:

	  perl scc.pl --prog scp --pki id_rsa.ppk \
		      --dest root@scc_srv.domain.com:/var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp

       All  scc-data  from the Windows system(s) is transferred to scc-srv and
       will be shown after the next run of scc-update.	Note that you have  to
       use  the	 -f option for scc-update to add the name of the new client to
       the lists of the index.html file of the realms on the server.

       To enhance security, the transfer can be done via a separate,  non-root
       account	scc. Create a subdirectory scc in /var/opt/scc-srv/data/trans‐
       fer/cp, chown this directory to user scc and add the  public  key  from
       puttygen to the file ~scc/.ssh/authorized_keys.


1mPROGRAMS0m
       The programs of SCC have the following relationship:

       scc: main program
       this program calls scc-log and sends data to the SCC-server.
       scc-log: this program calls:
       - scc-collect: collect all data by calling modules in scc_modules
       - compare new and old snapshots, add differences to logbook
       - scc-snap2html: convert snapshot to HTML
       - scc-log2html: convert logbook to HTML


1mUSING SCC0m
       After  the  installation, the data is available in directory 4mdata.24m	The
       file 4mscc.&lt;hostname&gt;.log24m contains the logbook and  the  file	 4mscc.&lt;host‐0m
       4mname&gt;.cur24m contains the current snapshot.

       To  run SCC again, just start 4mscc.24m	To keep an accurate logbook of your
       system, you can schedule it daily.  Just make sure you "run as"	admin‐
       istrator.   Being a member of the local admin group is insufficient for
       collecting some of the data.

       To run SCC on several systems, use the --file option to indicate a file
       containing  the	names  of the systems you want SCC to run on.  You can
       also use the --list option to specify the systems in a  comma-separated
       list.   Finally you can use the --netview option to run SCC on all sys‐
       tems reported by command "net view".  In	 any  case,  you  need	domain
       admin priviliges to collect data remotely via WMI from other systems.

       Use  your favorite scheduler (scheduled actions) to schedule scc-win to
       run on a regular basis.


1mCUSTOMIZING/EXTENDING SCC0m
       1mscc-collect(1) 22mcollects OS and OS-related configuration data.  It  does
       not  collect  data  of  the  applications you developed.	 To extend the
       snapshots, refer to the manual page  of	1mscc-plugin(1).   22mIt  offers  a
       starting point to collect other configuration data.


1mPERFORMANCE0m
       Usually scc completes its runs within several seconds.  When you notice
       that runs of scc on a system take very long to complete,	 you  can  use
       the  profiling data to determine the cause.  Profiling data is added to
       the snapshot and can be found in the html-file  under  the  classifica‐
       tion:  "profiling".   Each  line	 of the profiling data consists of the
       following fields:
       - timestamp
       - seconds since previous stamp
       - seconds since start of run
       - comment
       Look for large values in the second column to locate the	 code  of  scc
       that is causing this performance problem.  You can also use the --trace
       option to actually see the progress of the collection of the data.


1mLIMITATIONS0m
       The system module of SCC is partially skipped when it is installed on a
       win2k  system as the schtasks.exe program is not present on the system.
       Install SCC on a more recent version of Windows and  collect  the  data
       remotely.  This has been reported by Markdmcbride.
