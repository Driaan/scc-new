<H2> NAME</H2>
<PRE>

	scc-receive-mail - receive snapshot-files through email

</PRE>
<H2> RELEASE</H2>
<PRE>

	scc-srv	1.19.44

</PRE>
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<PRE>

	scc-receive-mail [ &lt;dir&gt; ]

</PRE>
<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
<PRE>

	Receive snapshot-files sent by scc via email. The program is activated 
	through an email-alias, transferred files are put in &lt;dir&gt;.

	The files to be transferred can be several MB. Check the mail-
	connectivity first by using the -t option for scc. This will 
	send empty files.

	When the sendmail restricted shell (smrsh) option is enabled, only
	programs in the directory /etc/smrsh can be activated through an
	email alias. Link this program and cat, as that is the only 
	sub-program that is used:

	        cd /etc/smrsh
	        ln -s /opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail .
	        ln -s $(which cat) .

	When selinux is enabled, make sure that the mail daemon has permission
	to create files in the destination directory:

	        chcon -R system_u:object_r:mail_spool_t:s0 &lt;dir&gt;

</PRE>
<H2> OPTIONS</H2>
<PRE>

	None.

</PRE>
<H2> ARGUMENTS</H2>
<PRE>

	&lt;dir&gt;   destination directory for the received files, make sure
	        that this directory has the proper permissions when
		accessed by a program executed via an email alias.
	        Default directory is /var/opt/scc-srv/transfer/mail.

</PRE>
<H2> WARNING</H2>
<PRE>

	Use of this alias-construct, makes it possible that a Denial Of
	Service is started by sending large amounts of snapshots to the
	server.

</PRE>
<H2> DIAGNOSTICS</H2>
<PRE>

	This program does not issue any messages. It&#39;s structure is very
	simple and there are limited options to issue messages when 
	activated though an email alias.

</PRE>
<H2> RETURN VALUE</H2>
<PRE>

	Upon completion, the program returns 0 to avoid returning all files 
	to the sender upon detecting an error. Errors are not signalled.

</PRE>
<H2> EXAMPLES</H2>
<PRE>

	To take a daily snapshot and transfer the files to myserver, use a 
	cronjob like:

	   0 23 * * * /opt/scc/bin/scc -s scc-transfer@mysrv.mydom

	This runs scc-log daily and transfers the files to mysrv. On this 
	system the alias file should contain a line like:

	   scc-transfer: "|/opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail "

	Note that scc-receive-mail is run through postfix/sendmail, and does
	not run as root. On a HP-UX/sendmail system, the program is launched
	as daemon/other on a RedHat/sendmail as mail/mail. Use the appropriate 
	permissions for the directories and scc-receive-mail.

	To reduce the likelihood of DOS-attacks, you should use a non-obvious 
	email-alias and not the alias from this documentation.
