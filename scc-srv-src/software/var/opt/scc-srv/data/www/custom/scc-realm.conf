# This file specifies the customization of the HTML-production for a specific realm.
#
# It is installed in directory /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/custom. Each new realm uses
# a symlink to this file from its own custom subdirectory.
#
# To avoid that each install of scc-srv overwrites your changes to this file,
# remove the symlink from the custom directory of the realm and copy from the
# installed file. Remove the symlink from a specific realm and copy and alter
# the installed file to customize a single realm.
#

# By default statistics are enabled for realms.
# Uncomment the next line to disable statistics for this realm
#export SCC_STATS="no"
# After disabling statistics, run: scc-update -f

# Uncomment and change the following lines to change the resolution of the statistics graphs
#export SCC_STATS_X_RES=1024
#export SCC_STATS_Y_RES=768
# After changing the resolution, run: scc-update -f
