This file describes the hierarchy of the source tarball when it is unpacked.
Note that the sourceforge SVN hierarchy differs from the hierarchy in the source tarball.

The source tarball hierarchy can be used to install the software by means of the command:

	./scc-srv-install

It can also be used to customize the software before packaging it.
The packaging can be done with the following programs (in alphabetical order):

	- debian-gen-scc-srv		DEB for Debian
	- dragonflybsd-gen-scc-srv	TGZ for DragonFlyBSD
	- freebsd-gen-scc-srv		TGZ for FreeBSD
	- hpux-gen-scc-srv		SD-UX format for HP-UX
	- netbsd-gen-scc-srv		TGZ for NetBSD
	- openbsd-gen-scc-srv		TGZ for OpenBSD
	- pacman-gen-scc-srv		.pkg.tar.gz for ArchLinux
	- puppy-gen-scc-srv		PET for PuppyLinux
	- rpm-gen-scc-srv		RPM
	- slackware-gen-scc-srv		TGZ for Slackware
	- src-gen-scc-srv		source format
	- sunos-gen-scc-srv		package format for Solaris
	- ttylinux-gen-scc-srv		TBZ for ttylinux

These commands should be used in the top directory of the untarred source tarball.
The resulting package, rpm, depot or tgz-file is located in this top directory.
Other files and subdirectories are removed. Use script scc-srv_gen_all to
generate all packages in the subdirectory "packages". This script does
not remove other files and subdirectories.

To install scc-srv in non-default directories you have to untar the
source tarball, edit the script relocate, run it, followed by src-gen-scc-srv.
This produces a new source tarball that can be used to produce other package formats.
Note that some of the gen scripts already use relocate and they are ignored.
To change the directories for those scripts, you have to change the corresponding
script.

The following list summarizes the steps to get scc-srv working. We assume that 
SCC-data is transferred via scp. Refer to scc-srv.5 for a more detailled 
description and other setups.

1  activate the web server
2  install scc-srv
3  call scc-setup and check that all configuration variables are known
4  activate the configuration by scc-setup -a
5  schedule scc-update to process incoming SCC-data, frequency depends
   upon the amount of data and time of arrival of new SCC-data.
      scc-update	# no arguments/options required

When you have password-less access to your clients, you can use
scc-pull to pull the scc-files from the clients.
