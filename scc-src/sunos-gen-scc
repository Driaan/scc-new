# This program requires to be called in a directory with the following hierarchy:
#
#	install			pre/post install scripts
#	software/opt/scc	bin, doc and man
#	software/etc/opt/scc	conf and newconfig
#	software/var/opt/scc	data
#
# After using this program, the directory contains one file:

#
# Provide an alternative version as first argument.
# Be aware of the limitations in the format of the version.
