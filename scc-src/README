This file decsribes the hierarchy of the source tarball when it is unpacked.
Note that the sourceforge SVN hierarchy differs from the hierarchy in this source tarball.

This directory contains the scripts to produce packaged scc. Directory 'install'
contains the pre- and post-install scripts. Directory 'software' contains the
hierarchy of the installable scripts of scc.

Please refer to file software/opt/scc/doc/README for details of the installation
and use of scc.

The source tarball hierarchy can be used to install an unpackaged version of the
software by means of the command:

	./scc-install

Please note that this copies the files from the software/opt/scc hierarchy 
to /opt/scc. A warning is issued when using the source install on a system 
with a packaged version of scc. The output from '/opt/scc/bin/scc --version'
and 'rpm -q scc' or 'pkginfo -l scc' will differ. Correct this by again 
installing a packaged version of scc.

Packaging the software in native systems formats should be done with the following
programs (in alphabetical order):

	- debian-gen-scc	DEB for Debian
	- dragonflybsd-gen-scc	TGZ for DragonFlyBSD
	- freebsd-gen-scc	TGZ for FreeBSD
	- hpux-gen-scc		SD-UX format for HP-UX
	- netbsd-gen-scc	TGZ for NetBSD
	- openbsd-gen-scc	TGZ for OpenBSD
	- pacman-gen-scc	.pkg.tar.gz for ArchLinux
	- puppy-gen-scc		PET for PuppyLinux
	- rpm-gen-scc		RPM
	- slackware-gen-scc	TGZ for Slackware
	- src-gen-scc		source format
	- sunos-gen-scc		package format for Solaris
	- ttylinux-gen-scc	TBZ for ttylinux

These commands should be used in the top directory of the untarred source tarball.
The resulting package, rpm, depot or tgz-file is located in this top directory,
while other files and subdirectories are removed. Use script scc_gen_all to
generate all packages in the subdirectory "packages". This script does not remove
other files and subdirectories and reports and skips formats whose specific 
packaging tools are absent.

To install scc in non-default directories you have to use the relocate script. Refer
to the script for details. After that call one packaging script or scc_gen_all, that
skips the generate scripts that already use the relocate script.

Customization of the software is preferably done after retrieving the software
from the SVN repository at SourceForge. Refer to the README file in the trunk
directory of scc for further details.
