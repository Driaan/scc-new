<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
<PRE>
       System  Configuration Collector is yet another configuration collector.
       Just like the other collectors it collects configuration data  on  Unix
       systems. The difference is that each line of collected data is extended
       with a hierarchical classification of the nature of the data  and  with
       an  indicator  whether  that  data is supposed to be static or dynamic.
       For example: the size of a file system is static data and  the  current
       usage  is  dynamic  data. Consecutive collections of configuration data
       (snapshots) are compared and differences in the static data  are	 added
       to  a  logbook.	Filling a file system will not be reported in the log-
       book, but the extension of a file system will be.  Additional  software
       converts the snapshot and logbook to html-format.

       The  classification  of the data is a hierarchy with the following top-
       level items (among others):

       - general
       - boot
       - hardware
       - Volume Management
       - kernel
       - network
       - software
       - system
       - users

<H2> Summary of transfer of SCC-data</H2>
<PRE>
       Basically there are three setups: push, pull and two-step.

       In the push setup, all clients schedule <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> with the -p and  the  -s
       options and transferred data is processed on scc-srv by means of sched-
       uled invocations of scc-update.	This setup requires (non-root)	access
       of all clients to scc-srv, except when data is transferred via email.

       In the pull setup, scc-srv schedules scc-pull with the -R option to run
       the client, obtain the data and process	the  transferred  data.	  This
       setup  requires	superuser  access  from	 scc-srv  to  all  clients and
       involves all systems in a realm and all scc client  scripts  should  be
       accessible via the same path.  Note that scc-win clients do not support
       pulling scc data.

       In the two-step setup, all clients schedule <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> with -p pull	option
       without the -s option and scc-srv schedules scc-pull with the -R and -n
       options to obtain and process the client	 data.	 This  setup  requires
       (non-root)  access from scc-srv to all clients and involves all systems
       in a realm and all scc client data should be accessible	via  the  same
       path.

       These three setups could be mixed on a realm basis.

<H2> INSTALLATION</H2>
<PRE>
       SCC  is	available  in many native system package formats and also as a
       source tarball.	The software from the depots/packages/rpms on the web-
       site  is	 NOT relocatable, it installs in /opt/scc/bin Data- and tempo-
       rary files are located in /var/opt/scc and config files in /etc/opt/scc
       It  is  possible	 to install the software in other directories.	Unpack
       the source tarball, edit and use the relocate script and	 generate  the
       required	 rpm/package.	Throughout this documentation only the default
       directories are mentioned.

       During the pre-install phase, the software runs	a  possibly  installed
       version	of SCC to capture the changes in configuration just before the
       installation.  During the post-install phase, the software removes  the
       current	snapshot  (made by the previous version of SCC) and starts the
       new version of SCC.  This means that SCC does not compare two  possibly
       incompatible  snapshots,	 avoiding  flooding  the  logbook with changes
       caused by code changes.

       This means that the installation may take  some	time  (typically  less
       than  5 minutes).  On a moderate pentium with CentOS 6, SCC completed a
       run within 1.5 minutes.	On large  and  overloaded  servers,  SCC  will
       require much longer.

       To install release 1.26.73 of the source package, use the commands:
	    tar xf scc-1.26.73.src.tar
	    cd scc-1.26.73
	    ./scc-install


</PRE>
<H2> PROGRAMS</H2>
<PRE>
       The programs of SCC have the following relationship:

       scc: main program
       this program calls scc-log and sends data to the SCC-server.
       scc-log: this program calls:
       - scc-collect: collect all data by calling modules in scc_modules
       - scc-cmp: compare new and old snapshots, add differences to logbook
       - scc-snap2html: convert snapshot to HTML
       - scc-log2html: convert logbook to HTML


</PRE>
<H2> USING SCC</H2>
<PRE>
       After   the   installation,   the   data	  is  available	 in  directory
       /var/opt/scc/data.  The file scc.&lt;hostname&gt;.log	contains  the  logbook
       and the file scc.&lt;hostname&gt;.cur contains the current snapshot.

       To  run	SCC  again,  just start /opt/scc/bin/scc.  To keep an accurate
       logbook of your system, you can schedule it with cron:

	    0 6 * * * /opt/scc/bin/scc

       Any errors produced by programs called by scc-collect, appear under the
       classification  "messages".  Most of the times they indicate some hard-
       ware or software error on the system.  Running SCC is some  kind	 of  a
       health check for your system.

       It is possible to send your SCC-data (snapshots, logbooks and the html-
       files) to a  server  running  the  server-software  of  SCC  (scc-srv).
       Before  you  send your data to a server, you have to prepare the server
       by installing scc-srv and configuring the server.  On the server,  sum-
       maries of the SCC-data are generated and all data is accessible through
       a web-interface.

       To mark the completion of certain changes you performed	on  a  system,
       use  the	 -c  option  of	 <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A>.  To mark changes in the snapshot when
       implementing a RFC, use the following commands:

       scc		  # record changes up to this moment
       # perform the tasks required by the RFC
       scc -c "RFC 123"	  # record changes due to RFC

<H2> CUSTOMIZING/EXTENDING SCC</H2>
<PRE>
       <A HREF="scc-collect.html">scc-collect(1)</A> and its modules use sensible defaults to avoid that many
       systems	require	 a configuration file.	When the defaults are insuffi-
       cient, check the code for a reference  of  scc-localize.	  This	script
       contains	 several  environment variables that influence the behavior of
       scc.   To  adjust  scc,	copy  /etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-localize   to
       /etc/opt/scc/conf/scc-localize  and  uncomment  the required variables.
       When the -no_conf_sub_dir option was used with	the  relocate  script,
       the copy is not required.

       <A HREF="scc-collect.html">scc-collect(1)</A>  collects OS and OS-related configuration data.  It does
       not collect data of the applications  you  developed.   To  extend  the
       snapshots,  refer  to  the  manual  page of <A HREF="scc-plugin.html">scc-plugin(1)</A>.  It offers a
       starting point to collect other configuration data.

       DBAs will only be interested in part of the SCC-data of a  system.   By
       using the file /etc/opt/scc/conf/scc-split.conf it is possible to split
       the snapshot in several parts.  Each Oracle SID can have its own	 snap-
       shot  and  logfile.   When  these snapshots are send to the scc-server,
       they can be added to a separate realm that only	contains  SCC-data  of
       Oracle  SIDs.   Refer  to  /etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-split.conf and to
       <A HREF="scc-log.html">scc-log(1)</A> for examples and more details.

       SCC ships with several user modules that are not run by default.	 Check
       the  directory /opt/scc/bin/scc_modules for scripts containing "_u_" in
       their name.  These are user-modules that can be activated by  means  of
       the  -e	option of scc.	Refer to the manual page of <A HREF="scc-collect.html">scc-collect(1)</A> and
       <A HREF="scc.html">scc(1)</A> for a more detailed description of the use of modules.

       Module scc_0640_s_local uses a configuration file to collect  the  con-
       tents  of additional files.  Use this module to extend the SCC snapshot
       on individual systems.  To extend the SCC snapshot on all systems,  you
       better customize the code and generate your own version of SCC.

       To  add or modify specific user modules for all your systems, customize
       the depot/rpm and packages.  This can  be  achieved  by	unpacking  the
       source  tarball	and adding/modifying the required files.  Refer to the
       README file in the source tree for more	details	 concerning  producing
       the  depot/rpm/package.	Refer to <A HREF="scc-plugin.html">scc-plugin(1)</A> for more details of new
       modules.

<H2> PERFORMANCE</H2>
<PRE>
       Usually scc completes its runs within minutes.  When  you  notice  that
       runs  of	 scc  on  a system take very long to complete, you can use the
       profiling data to determine the cause.  Profiling data is added to  the
       snapshot	 and  can  be found in the html-file under the classification:
       "profiling".  The html file of the snapshot contains a "Statistics" ta-
       ble  containing	the  processing times of (parts of) the modules.  Look
       for large values in the "Module seconds" column to locate the  code  of
       scc  that  is  causing  this performance problem.  Optionally add extra
       calls to the scc_timing function to exactly determine the bottleneck.


</PRE>
<H2> SECURITY</H2>
<PRE>
       As the programs of SCC is by default run as root to obtain all the nec-
       essary  configuration  data,  the  environment of SCC must be well pro-
       tected.	This is accomplished by creating separate directories for  the
       data and programs of SCC and properly securing them.

       Optionally a source package can be build from the SVN sources that will
       run SCC as an ordinary user.  Note that this reduces the amount of col-
       lected  configuration data and could lead to "messages" in the snapshot
       when used programs produce data on stderr as they  are  not  called  by
       root.
