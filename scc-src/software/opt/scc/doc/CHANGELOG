Changes from scc 1.21.110 (2015-12-01) to 1.22.19 (2015-12-24)
==============================================================
  general:
    A new packaging method for transferring SCC data to scc-srv has been implemented as the current method
    is hard to maintain and uses separate code for email and other transfer mechanisms.
    By default, the old packaging method is used. The 1.15 release of scc-srv handles both packaging formats.
    So, upgrade to at least release 1.15 of scc-srv before using the new option "-o new_pack".
    The new method supports encrypted transfer of data for all transport mechanisms.
  build:
    Start new release.
  scc:
    Specify encryption of transfer data via entry in scc-localize.
    Make sure that -t option transfer the correct files.
    Add -o new_pack option to use new packaging method of scc data.
    Use correct uuencoded filename for new packaging method.
    Pack the data of the last run when the --norun option is used and no data is available in the transfer directory.
  scc-localize:
    Specify encryption of transfer data via entry in scc-localize.
  scc_modules/scc_0000_s_general:
    Determine memory for BSD-systems.
    Use -m option of /usr/bin/free to avoid truncation of size (suggested by Frans Postma).
  scc_modules/scc_0100_s_boot:
