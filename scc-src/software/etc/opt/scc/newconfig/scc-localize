# ID:          $Id: scc-localize 6216 2019-03-21 20:47:50Z siemkorteweg $

# Purpose of this file:
# scc-collect and its modules use sensible defaults to avoid that 
# many systems require a configuration file. When the defaults are
# insufficient, copy /etc/opt/scc/newconfig/scc-localize
# to /etc/opt/scc/conf/scc-localize and uncomment the required variables.
# When the software has been relocated during packaging and the --no_conf_sub_dir
# option was used, the copy is not required.

#	General variables 
##############################################################################

# The scripts use a limited list of directories to search for programs.
# Adjust the following line to extend this list.
export SCC_PATH=""
# Access to additional directories should be restricted to root.
# This mechanism replaces the separate variables in this file used until version 1.11.20.
if [ -n "${SCC_PATH}" ]
then
	PATH="${PATH}:${SCC_PATH}"
fi
# Add the default EMC Symmetrix directory:
if [ -d /usr/symcli/bin ]
then
	PATH=${PATH}:/usr/symcli/bin
fi

export SCC_PROFILING="yes"
# To remove timing info from the snapshot (under class "stats:profiling::")
# uncomment the following line:
# export SCC_PROFILING=""

export SCC_CLASS_MAP=""
# Uncomment and change the following variable to "map" classifications. 
# Each line should contain <src_classation>|<dest_classification>.
# Empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored.
# Errors during processing are signalled via "var:messages::" in the snapshot.
#
# Examples are:
# - to change ":software:oracle:" into ":oracle:", use: ":software:oracle:|:oracle:"
# - to avoid changes in cronjob data, use: "fix:software:cron:|var:software:cron:"
#
# Note:
# - use scc-log -r after changing the contents of this variable to avoid many changes in the logbook
#   at the cost of not recording the change of scc-localize in the logbook
# - be aware that mapping the ":software:installed *:" classifications will impact scc-smt in scc-srv
#
#export SCC_CLASS_MAP="
#"

export SCC_ROOT_PW=""
# On some systems the root password is changed frequently. Any value different from "var"
# avoids collecting a checksum of the root password.
# Uncomment the following variable to avoid collecting a checksum of the root password:
# export SCC_ROOT_PW=var

# Account data from accounts with UID < MAX_SYS_ACCOUNT_ID have fixed data,
# other accounts var data. Uncomment the following line to change the defaults
# set in scc-collect.
#export MAX_SYS_ACCOUNT_ID=1000

# Indicate whether the entries in the logbook are determined with "context" diff (-u option).
# Uncomment the following line to activate this option (provided diff supports this option).
#export SCC_CONTEXT_DIFF="yes"

# Indicate whether transfer data should be encrypted by means of the path of the public key file
# of scc-srv. Refer to scc-srv(5) for the details concerning this file. An empty variable means
# "NO" encryption. Change the contents of this variable to the full path of the public key.
export SCC_KEY_FILE=""

# When two hosts share the same hostname, uncomment the following variable and assign
# an unique alias for this host. All scc-files in SCC_DATA use the hostname, only the
# transferred files to scc-srv are renamed.
#export SCC_HOST_ALIAS=unique

# Variable data in snapshots can be shown in a different color. 
# The specification of the color has moved to the style.css.

#	Variables for Oracle
##############################################################################

export ORATAB=/etc/oratab
# The default locations for the oratab file are /etc/oratab or
# /var/opt/oracle/oratab. Uncomment and change the ORATAB variable if this file 
# is in another location.
# export ORATAB=/etc/oratab

export ORA_USE_PROFILE=0
# Usually the Oracle commands (svrmgrl / sqlplus) can be executed with
# a su -c command, without using the .profile. ORACLE_SID and ORACLE_HOME
# are set anyway before calling su, so the .profile is not needed for that.
# However, sometimes critical settings and commands for for example memory
# windows are executed by the .profile, and in this case ORA_USE_PROFILE
# must be set to 1. If so, make sure the .profile for the oracle user does
# not contain TTY setting commands and the like if executed by su.
# export ORA_USE_PROFILE=1

# Usually the SQL*Net config files are located in either /etc (/var/opt/oracle),
# $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin, or both, but if they are located elsewhere,
# use TNS_ADMIN to specify that location
# export TNS_ADMIN=

# By default all Oracle users are listed. To suppres this, set ORA_LIST_USERS
# to 0
# export ORA_LIST_USERS=0

export IGNORE_NO_HW=0
# With ioscan on HP-UX, detached hardware gets the state NO_HW. In some
# circumstances this should be ignored, for example on a SAN with BC / BCV /
# snapshot functionality. If so, set IGNORE_NO_HW to 1.
# export IGNORE_NO_HW=1

export SCC_CONREP_TEMPLATE=
# To specify a non-default template for conrep, uncomment the following line and
# specify the full path of a template file.
# export SCC_CONREP_TEMPLATE=

export SCC_IGNORE_STM=no
# On some systems, (unpatched versions of) stm often hang. When upgrading
# cannot be done immediately, set the following variable to ignore stm. As the
# stm-data is variable in the snapshot, it does not matter for the logboook.
# export SCC_IGNORE_STM=yes

export SCC_IGNORE_ACUCLI=no
# To skip the collection of the HP Proliant Support Pack data, uncomment the
# following line.
# export SCC_IGNORE_ACUCLI=yes

#	Variables for network chapter
##############################################################################

export SCC_VAR_ROUTE_DATA=no
# Systems connected to networks with many ICMP redirects, suffer from many
# changes in the logbooks as these new routes are not marked dynamic.
# Uncomment the following variable to set all network routing output from netstat
# as variable data. The configuration of the static routes is captured in the
# networking configuration files.
# export SCC_VAR_ROUTE_DATA=yes

export SCC_IGNORE_CDP=no
# When Cisco Discovery Protocol is not in use, the collection of this data
# requires a timeout. Uncomment the following variable to skip the collection
# of CDP data.
# export SCC_IGNORE_CDP=yes

# export OPCDWN=0

export OPCDWN_DIR="${SCC_TMP}/opcsplit"
# By default the following directory is used for configuration downloads:
# ${SCC_TMP}/opcsplit. If a download should be used from a different location,
# set the OPCDWN_DIR directory to that path.

export SCC_SCR_DETAILS="no"
# Uncomment the following line to activate the collection of System Configuration Repository details.
# export SCC_SCR_DETAILS="yes"

# To avoid many changes in the logbook when dynamic iptables rules are added/deleted, all "dynamic" data is
# tagged variable. You can "label" your FW data by adding the following to all your iptables commands
#       -m comment --comment "your label".
# Change the contents of the following variable when you use another label.
