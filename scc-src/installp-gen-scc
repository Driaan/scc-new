# SCC-release: 1.26.73
# ID:          $Id: installp-gen-scc 6216 2019-03-21 20:47:50Z siemkorteweg $

# This program requires to be called in a directory with the following hierarchy:
#
#	install			pre/post install scripts
#	software/opt/scc	bin, doc and man
#	software/etc/opt/scc	conf and newconfig
#	software/var/opt/scc	data
#
# After using this program, the directory contains one file:
#
#	scc-1.26.73.1.bff
#
# Provide an alternative version as first argument.
# Be aware of the limitations in the format of the version.

ProgName=installp-gen-scc

VERSION=${1:-1.26.73}

# Check for id 0 (run as root)
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]
then
	echo "${ProgName}: only root should run this program" >&2
	exit 2
fi

if [ ! -x /usr/sbin/mkinstallp ]
then
	echo "${ProgName}: cannot access /usr/sbin/mkinstallp (install from bos.adt.insttools)" >&2
	exit 2
fi

# The directory software will be our buildroot and is already in the correct layout

# The order of the installp scripts is:
# - install
#   - pre-install
#   - post-install
#   - config
# - upgrade
#   - pre-remove (of previous version)
#   - pre-install (previous version of software not present anymore)
#   - post-install
#   - config
# - remove
#   - unconfig
#   - unpre-install

# To run the new version of scc, the post-install will do.
# To run the previous version with an upgrade, use the pre-remove script.
# To run a source install of scc upon installation of installp package, use the pre-install.
# Upon upgrade, both the pre-remove and the pre-install scripts will run.
# As scc has been removed between the runs of these scripts, it will only run once during upgrade.

# Keywords for scripts:
# Pre-installation Script: /path/script
# Unpre-installation Script: /path/script
# Post-installation Script: /path/script
# Pre_rm Script: /path/script
# Configuration Script: /path/script
# Unconfiguration Script: /path/script

# Create the template file:
# Version of the package: use ScS_ReLeAsE and add .1
