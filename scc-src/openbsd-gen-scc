# ID:          $Id: openbsd-gen-scc 6216 2019-03-21 20:47:50Z siemkorteweg $

# This program requires to be called in a directory with the following hierarchy:
#
#	install			pre/post install scripts
#	software/opt/scc	bin, doc and man
#	software/etc/opt/scc	conf and newconfig
#	software/var/opt/scc	data
#
# Program relocate is used to change this default hierarchy into OpenBSD practices:
#
#	install					pre/post install scripts
#	software/usr/local			bin and man
#	software/usr/local/share/doc/scc	doc
#	software/etc/scc			conf and newconfig
#	software/usr/local/share/scc		data
#
# After using this program, the directory contains the file:
#
#	scc-1.26.73.OpenBSD.tgz
#
# Provide an alternative version as first argument.
# Be aware of the limitations in the format of the version.
